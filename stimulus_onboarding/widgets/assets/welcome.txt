In *Most* bio deep learning projects, data follows the same path:

Bio sample -> lab preparation -> machine -> automatic data processing -> custom scientific tooling -> deep learning scientist -> neural network



Problem?

As a deep learning scientist, the probability of interacting with the actors of the data chain exponentially decreases as they get further away from you.

Those actors design dataset processing with humans in mind, but you, are training a machine. Humans and machines need different data pre-processing strategies!

Best would be if you could design the process end-to-end, and explore the data parameter space (for example, by running ablations on the various pre-processing methods and their parameters).

Unfortunately, bioinformatics tooling is buggy, written in unpopular languages, hard to install, does not interact with deep learning software...

So we did the hard work for you, and deliver a [underline]Bio Machine Learning Operation framework (Bio-MLOps)[/underline] that allows you to run state of the art bioinformatics tooling AND deep learning software in the same place.
