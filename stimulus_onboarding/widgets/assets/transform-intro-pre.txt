Remember the processing chain: 

.h5ad data -> remove low-variance genes -> misc. transforms -> PCA -> train decoder 

Keeping only some highly variable genes is often done in single-cell RNA-seq as a first step to reduce dimensionality, we also usually apply some log transformation to the data (but can do other pre-processing steps at this stage). And then we can furthermore compress with a PCA transformation. 

You get it now, but as per the minimal abstraction principle, we should implement those transform at this stage... except this would take a long time and well made libraries (like scanpy) already do the job. 

So we can import this librairy and use any functionality it provides through the configuration file, for example in the config file :
