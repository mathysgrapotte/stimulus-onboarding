To make the onboarding process easier to understand, we will consider an example:

You are tasked to build a Virtual Cell Model (VCM), to do this, you plan on first predicting response to CRISPRi knockout experiments. 

-> a gene is deactivated using CRISPRi, what is the induced response on the cell?

Let's visualize the dataset we are working with...
