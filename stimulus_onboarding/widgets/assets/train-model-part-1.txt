In stimulus, your model lives in its own .py file. Why ? Same reasons as configs, we want something that lives on its own git for version control and clarity and that you can share with others.

This .py files need to follow some conventions : 

First, your model has to be called **Model**, this is how stimulus currently imports your model's code.

Then, the model needs to implement three functions in addition to the PyTorch required functions, {{italic: train_batch}}, {{italic: validate}} and {{italic: inference}}.

Additionally, the {{italic: __init__}} matters, let's have a look...
