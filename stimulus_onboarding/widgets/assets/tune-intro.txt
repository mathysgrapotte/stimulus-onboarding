Now it's time to run the hyperparameter tuning with {{italic: stimulus tune}}.

This command will use Optuna to search for the best hyperparameters for your model. It will:

1. Load the transformed data from {{italic: output/vcc_2000}}
2. Read the model configuration from {{italic: data/pca_reconstruction_config.yaml}}
3. Import your model class from {{italic: data/pca_reconstructor.py}}
4. Run multiple trials, pruning bad ones early
5. Save the best model to {{italic: output/pca_reconstruction/best_model.safetensors}}

Let's run it!
