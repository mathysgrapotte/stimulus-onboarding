Couple of things are important to note: 
- the seed parameter is back
- we have a transform field where we need to provide our transformations 
- this transform is named, this will be useful later
- we have a column field, this defines which column we want to apply the transformation to (note that in single cell, the 'X' column contains the rnaseq counts)
- we call the same ScanpyTransform multiple times, but with different parameters, this shows that we call the scanpy librairy, and the parameters define which function we want to use in scanpy 
- we can add additional parameters that will be passed to the ScanPy transformation as arguments 

Let's run the transform command:
