Here, we decide to split the dataset based on the 'target_gene' column, with a ratio of 80% in train and 20% in validation (so 80% of the targeted genes will go to the train set and 20% to the val set).

This means that train and validation have cells where a different gene has been knocked out, so we expect those to be fairly different.

Every stimulus config also gets a 'seed' parameter to control for reproducibility.

{{italic:The attentive reader will notice that there is no mention of a test set. That's intended, we believe that test sets should be carefully engineered and not automatically generated, so we expect the user to provide it.}}
